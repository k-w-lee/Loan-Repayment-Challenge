    "As a result from the exploratory, we can know that a loan is risky when the loan payment checked percentage below 30%. This is because the average payment checked percentage of overall payment is 30.4079%. Therefore, the loan status such as \"Internal Collection\", ''Charged Off Paid Off'.\"External Collection\", \"Returned Item\" are considered risky. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that we need to reduce the likelihood of unfavorable loan status before it has happend. But how can we do that? One of the methods proposed here is to use supervised learning classification method to predict the loan status given the loan data. So that company can take initiative to reject high risk loans before they are funded. This notebook will also show how the classification method implemented\n",
